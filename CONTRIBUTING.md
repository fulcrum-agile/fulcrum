# Contributing to CM42 Central
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

You'll find below what you should know before get started:

### Code of Conduct
Don't be a jerk.

## Testing
Most of our testbed consists of RSpec examples. Please write RSpec examples for new code you create.

### Pull Requests
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to cm42-central](https://github.com/Codeminer42/cm42-central/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, we will be thankful if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit) and include screenshots or animated GIFs whenever possible.

Also, don't forget to fill our [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Codeminer42/cm42-central/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with all your changes. They have to fit in one of these categories: *Added*, *Changed*, *Fixed* or *Removed*. Add it to `Unreleased` and we'll make sure to properly move to a new release when we create it.

At last, always write a clear log message for your commit.

Thank you! :facepunch:
