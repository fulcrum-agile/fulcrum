Fulcrum
=======

Fulcrum is an application to provide a user story based backlog management
system for agile development teams.

Goals
-----

Fulcrum is a clone of [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/).  It will
almost certainly never surpass the functionality, usability and sheer
awesomeness of Pivotal Tracker, but aims to provide a usable alternative for
users who require a Free and Open Source solution.

Roadmap
-------

Please note, any resemblance of the roadmap to the actual development timeline
is purely coincidental.

* User accounts
* Projects
* Stories, Bugs and Chores
* Iterations
* Comments
* CSV import / export
* Time tracking
