Fulcrum
=======

Fulcrum is an application to provide a user story based backlog management
system for agile development teams.  See
[the project page](http://wholemeal.co.nz/projects/fulcrum.html) for more
details.

Get involved
------------

Fulcrum is still in early development, so now is the time to make your mark on
the project.

There are several communication channels for Fulcrum:

* [Follow @fulcrumagile on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fulcrumagile)
* [Fulcrum Users](http://groups.google.com/group/fulcrum-users) - A general
  discussion group for users of Fulcrum.
* [Fulcrum Developers](http://groups.google.com/group/fulcrum-devel) - Discussion
  on the development of Fulcrum.
* You might also find someone in #fulcrum on the Freenode IRC network if you're
  looking for realtime help.

See the *Development* section below for details on contributing to the project.

Goals
-----

Fulcrum is a clone of [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/).  It will
almost certainly never surpass the functionality, usability and sheer
awesomeness of Pivotal Tracker, but aims to provide a usable alternative for
users who require a Free and Open Source solution.

Installation
------------

Fulcrum is still a work in progress, but if you're really keen to try it out
these instructions will hopefully help you get up and running.

First up, your system will need the
[prerequisites for running Ruby on Rails installed](http://rubyonrails.org/download)

Once you have these:

    # Checkout the project
    $ git clone git://github.com/malclocke/fulcrum.git
    $ cd fulcrum

    # Install the project dependencies
    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

    # Set up the development database
    $ bundle exec rake fulcrum:setup db:setup

    # Start the local web server
    $ rails server

You should then be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser.
You can log in with the test username `test@example.com`, password `testpass`.

Passenger Setup
---------------

If you are deploying to a production environment under Passenger, you may need to
pre-compile your assets to avoid errors:

    $ rake assets:precompile

In addition, you will want to configure 'config.action_mailer.default_url_options'
in config/environments/production.rb and 'config.mailer_sender' in 
config/initializers/devise.rb to ensure that user signup confirmation emails are sent.

Heroku setup
------------

If you wish to host a publicly available copy of Fulcrum, the easiest option is
to host it on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).

To deploy it to Heroku, make sure you have a local copy of the project; refer
to the previous section for instructions. Then:

    $ gem install heroku

    # Create your app. Replace APPNAME with whatever you want to name it.
    $ heroku create APPNAME --stack cedar

    # Define where the user emails will be coming from
    # (This email address does not need to exist)
    $ heroku config:add MAILER_SENDER=noreply@example.org

    # Allow emails to be sent
    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter

    # Deploy the first version
    $ git push heroku master

    # Set up the database
    $ heroku run rake db:setup

Once that's done, you will be able to view your site at
`http://APPNAME.herokuapp.com`.

Development
-----------

Fulcrum is currently welcoming contributions.  If you'd like to help:

* Check the [issue queue](http://github.com/malclocke/fulcrum/issues) for a
  list of the major features which are yet to be implemented.  These have the
  `feature` and `unstarted` labels.  If a feature you'd like to work on isn't
  there, add an issue.
* Leave a description of how you are going to implement the feature.  Failure
  to do this may lead to you implementing the feature in a way that might
  conflict with future plans for Fulcrum, and so increase the chances of your
  work being rejected or needing a rework.
* If you'd like to discuss anything about the issue in greater detail with
  other developers, do so on the
  [Fulcrum Developers](http://groups.google.com/group/fulcrum-devel) mailing
  list.

Here are some general guidelines for contributing:

* Make your changes on a branch, and use that branch as the base for pull
  requests.
* Try to break changes up into the smallest logical blocks possible.  We'd
  prefer to receive many small commits to one large one in a pull request.
* Feel free to open unfinished pull requests if you'd like to discuss work
  in progress, or would like other developers to test it.
* All patches changes be covered by tests, and should not break the existing
  tests, unless a current test is invalidated by a code change.  This includes
  Javascript, which is covered with a Jasmine test suite in `spec/javascripts/`.
* Run `rake spec` to check the Rails test suite is green. You will need 
  Firefox with Selenium installed to run the integration tests.
* To run the Javascript test suite, run `rake jasmine` and point your browser
  to `http://localhost:8888/`
* For any UI changes, please try to follow the
  [Tango theme guidelines](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines).
* The easiest way to test the impact of CSS or view changes is using the
  'testcard' at `http://localhost:3000/testcard`.  This is a fake project which
  exposes as many of the view states as possible on one page.
